The Special Products area of any store is a great way to highlight specific products, whether they are slow movers that need some extra attention, or regular store sellers. Now though, by using the Mailbeez Specials Module, you can easily drop your store&rsquo;s Specials into your email campaigns, whether they be review reminders, coupon, newsletter or despatch emails, giving your customers a big store experience, and potentially improving precious conversion rates.<br />
<br />
<b>Use your existing Specials data</b><br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ve already spent time assigning Specials, and handily, the Mailbeez Specials module takes your existing data, so you don&rsquo;t need to spend any extra time on your email campaigns replicating existing data.<br />
<br />
The result is less e-commerce administration, and more time getting on with the business of selling.
