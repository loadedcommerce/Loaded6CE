The Featured Products area of any store is a great way to highlight specific products, whether they are slow movers that need some extra attention, or regular store sellers. <br />
Now though, by using the Mailbeez Featured Products Module, you can easily drop your store&rsquo;s Featured products into your email campaigns, whether they be review reminders, coupon, newsletter or despatch emails, giving your customers a big store experience, and potentially improving precious conversion rates.

The result is less e-commerce administration, and more time getting on with the business of selling.
